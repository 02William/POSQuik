# POSQuik
Customer Information Management System (Java Desktop Application)

The application has an inventory section that keeps track of inventory stock items and a tools & machines section that helps keep a record of the quantity of tools, their location, and who is in possession of said items.
The point of sale section is linked with the inventory section, and whenever sales are made inventory stock items will be affected by the transactions.
The point of sale generates a A4 sized quotation/invoice pdf from sales items made on the point of sale system.

The project is useful to business owners who use manual handwritten methods to provide quotation/invoices/receipts to customers.

**NOTE** THE APPLICATION WORKS WITH A DATABASE AND WILL REQUIRE AN SQL DATABASE FOR THE APPLICATION TO BE FUNCTIONAL
